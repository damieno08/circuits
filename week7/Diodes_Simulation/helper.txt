This assignment will help students understand the importance of diode orientation and forward voltage.

The voltage across the series equivalent will always be the source voltage subtracted by the forward voltages summed.

Current will always be the voltage across the resistor equivalent divided by the resistance equivalent.

We then calculate the individual voltages by multiplying each resistance by current.

We then calculate power by multiplying voltage and current for each component.

Usage: solver.py [Source Voltage] [Resistor 1 in ohms] [Resistor 2 in ohms] [Resistor 3 in ohms]
