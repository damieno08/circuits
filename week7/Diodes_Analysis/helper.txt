This assignment will help students understand the importance of diode orientation and forward voltage.

The voltage across the resistor will always be the source voltage subtracted by the forward voltage.

Current will always be the voltage across the resistor divided by the resistance.

Usage: solver.py [Source Voltage] [Resistor 1 in ohms] [Resistor 2 in ohms]
